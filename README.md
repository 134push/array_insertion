Array Operations in C
Introduction
This project provides a simple C program for performing basic operations on arrays. It helps users create, modify, sort, and manage arrays directly from the command-line interface.​

Features
Create an array and display its elements.​

Insert new elements at a specific position.​

Sort the array in ascending order.​

Detect and delete duplicate elements from the array.​

Usage Instructions
Compile the code using any C compiler.

text
gcc practical-1.cpp -o array_ops
Run the executable:

text
./array_ops
Follow the prompts to:

Enter the number of array elements

Add new elements to the array

Sort the array and view the result

Check and remove duplicate elements

Example
text
Enter the number of array you want: 5
Enter elements: 1 2 3 2 4
Your array is: 1 2 3 2 4
Sorting the array...
Sorted array: 1 2 2 3 4
Checking for duplicates...
The duplicate number is: 2 found at index 1 and 2
Deleting duplicates...
Final array: 1 2 3 4
File Structure
